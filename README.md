# SwampBot
A JDA Discord bot that transmits a fever called 'Swamp Fever' through mentioning other users

# How to Setup the Bot
- To setup the bot, you need to create an application, then a bot in the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/login?redirect_to=%2Fdevelopers)
- Next, download this code into your preferred Java IDE (I recommend IntelliJ Idea) and take your bot's token and paste it into creds.secret under resources
- Then, you need to add the bot to your Discord server and find a way to host it (I'm broke and won't host this myself)
- After you have added it to the Discord server, you need to create a "Swamp Fever" role and copy its ID and replace the current ID of swampFeverRoleID with the new one in the 
'Startup' class
- After that you should be all set. You can add 'Immune Roles' in startup aswell
- If you have suggestions/comments/concerns just contact me
